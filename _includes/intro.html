I am a Ph.D. student at Osaka University, Japan.
My general research area is data mining and machine learning for time series.
Focuses on modeling complex, structural linear/non-linear patterns
and forecasting future events.
Applications include outlier detection
and event prediction in automated factories,
and user activity prediction on the web.
